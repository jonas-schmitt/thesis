In the last chapter, we have demonstrated that our grammar-based evolutionary search method has the capability discover multigrid methods of novel structure and which, in certain cases, yield faster solvers compared to all known multigrid cycles.
Furthermore, by applying the generalization procedure presented in  Section~\ref{sec:generalization}, we were able to evolve multigrid methods that achieve a high degree of efficiency over a set of increasingly-difficult instances of the same problem, while, in certain cases, these methods can even be generalized to larger problem instances than considered within their evolution.
However, since the application of artificial intelligence based methods to the solution of PDEs, it is important to classify the approach presented in this thesis within this new and quickly growing field.
