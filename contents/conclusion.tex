\paragraph{Conclusion}
We have started this thesis with an introduction to automated algorithm design methods and their successful application to different domains.
Since our main goal was to harness the potential of these methods for the automated design of multigrid methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), the question of whether we have achieved our original goals remains to be answered.
After establishing a theoretical foundation on multigrid methods, formal languages, and evolutionary program synthesis, in Chapter~\ref{chapter:multigrid-formal-language} we have derived a context-free grammar, which enables us to construct sequences of multigrid operations that could not yet be obtained with the classical formulation of these methods.
Building upon this foundation, we have then presented a prototypical implementation of our evolutionary program synthesis tool, called \emph{EvoStencils}, which automates the design and implementation of efficient and generalizable multigrid-based PDE solvers by leveraging the capabilities of the evolutionary computation library DEAP~\cite{rainville2012deap} and the ExaStencils~\cite{lengauer2020exastencils} code generation framework.
In Chapter~\ref{chapter:experiments}, we were then able to demonstrate that this approach yields efficient multigrid methods for different PDEs, whereby using the example of the indefinite Helmholtz equation, our automatically-designed solvers were even able to achieve super-human performance in an outstandingly-difficult benchmark problem for the application of numerical PDE solvers\footnote{For this result, the corresponding paper has been awarded the 2022 Humies Gold Award for Human-Competitive Results (\url{https://www.human-competitive.org/awards})}.
While we believe that this lays the foundation for the utilization of automated algorithm design methods within the domain of numerical PDE solvers, these multigrid methods only represent a tiny fraction of this vast research area.
We, therefore, believe that there exists a multitude of promising extensions of this work, some of which we briefly want to discuss in the following.
