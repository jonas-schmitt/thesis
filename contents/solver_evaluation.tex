Unfortunately, determining the spectral radius requires the computation of the eigenvalues of a matrix $G$, which, in general, is of complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ for $G \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$~\cite{demmel2007fast}.
In cases where the system of linear equations is obtained from the discretization of PDEs on a regular grid with uniform spacing and thus where the matrix $G$ is available in form of one or multiple stencil codes, it is possible to employ local Fourier analysis (LFA)~\cite{wienands2004practical}.
LFA considers a reformulation of the given problem on an infinite grid, which is transferred to the frequency domain to investigate the symbol of the underlying operator.
Based on the latter, an estimation of the spectral radius can then be computed in significantly less time.
