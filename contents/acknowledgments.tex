First of all, I want to thank my supervisor, Harald, who has not only always encouraged and supported me in all the choices I made during my PhD but also had faith in my abilities. His decision to enable my participation in my first scientific conference during my bachelor studies was instrumental in igniting my passion for research.

Furthermore, I'm immensely grateful for the support of my family, especially my mother, who was always there for me, even in the darkest hours of my life.

Finally, I want to thank Sophia for walking this path with me, no matter how difficult it was, and for always loving me even when I couldn't love myself.
