First and foremost, I’d like to express my immense gratitude to my supervisor, Harald. Not only has he consistently encouraged and supported me through every decision I made during my PhD journey, but his choice to involve me in my first scientific conference back in my bachelor days played a pivotal role in sparking my passion for research.

I’m also deeply thankful to Dietmar and Alexander for giving me the opportunity to continue my research at the Chair of Computer Architecture. Their exceptional collaboration and support have been invaluable. Moreover, my PhD journey would not have been possible without the financial backing from the Bavarian Graduate School of Computational Engineering (BGCE), which generously funded my work for several years.

I must also extend a huge thank you to my family, especially my mother, who was always there for me, even in the most challenging times of my life.

Last but certainly not least, I want to thank Sophia for being by my side on this journey, no matter how tough the road was, and for continually enriching it with love.
