\section{Discretization of Partial Differential Equations}\label{sec:discretization}
Many problems in science and engineering can be modeled as partial differential equations (PDEs)~\cite{folland2020introduction,evans2010partial}.
A PDE is an equation that contains functions of one or multiple variables together with their partial derivatives.
Consider, for instance, the equation
\begin{equation}
	-\alpha \nabla^2 u = f \quad \text{in} \; \Omega,
	\label{eq:heat-equation}
\end{equation}
where $u = u(\bm{x})$ and $f = f(\bm{x})$ are both functions with respect to the vector of space variables $\bm{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)^T$ and $\Omega \supset \mathbb{R}^d$.
Equation~\eqref{eq:heat-equation} describes the temperature distribution inside a medium whose thermal conductivity is determined by the coefficient $\alpha$ and which contains a heat source $f$.
Since Equation~\eqref{eq:heat-equation} is only satisfied in the interior of the domain $\Omega$, we, additionally, need to define a set of conditions at its boundaries.
These so-called \emph{boundary conditions} (BCs) can usually be classified into four different types:
\begin{description}
	\item[Dirichlet] $u(\bm{x}) = g(\bm{x})$
	\item[Neumann] $\frac{\partial}{\partial \vec{n}} u(\bm{x}) = 0$
	\item[Robin] $a u(\bm{x}) + b \frac{\partial}{\partial \vec{n}} u(\bm{x}) = g(\bm{x})$
	\item[Cauchy] $a u(\bm{x}) = g(\bm{x}), \; b \frac{\partial}{\partial \vec{n}} u(\bm{x}) = h(\bm{x})$.
\end{description}
Note that $\frac{\partial}{\partial \vec{n}} u(\bm{x})$ denotes the partial derivative of $u$ with respect to the outwards-directed normal vector of the boundary.
The difference between Robin and Cauchy BCs is that in the former case, one condition is formulated as a weighted average of $u$ and its derivative in the normal direction, while in the latter, two conditions must be met individually.
While depending on the boundary conditions, an analytical solution for Equation~\eqref{eq:heat-equation} might exist, for many PDEs, such a solution has not been discovered, or its computation is infeasible.
A remedy is the application of so-called numerical methods that are based on approximating the solution of a given PDE on a discrete set of points. 
%\subsection{Grid Creation}
%Before computing a numerical approximation of the solution of a given PDE, we need to define a set of discrete points within the domain $\Omega$ at which we aim to obtain the solution.
Usually, these points are defined on a \emph{grid} or \emph{mesh} with a particular structure.
In general, a distinction is made between structured (or regular) and unstructured grids.
A structured grid is characterized by the uniform neighborhood of its grid points, which means that the number of neighbors is typically the same for each grid point.
In contrast, each point within an unstructured grid can have a varying number of neighbors.
Computations are usually easier to implement and more efficient on structured grids due to their regularity.
However, structured grids are often challenging to create on complicated and irregular domains.
On the other hand, unstructured grids offer a higher degree of flexibility and are also well-suited for the previously mentioned cases~\cite{knupp2020fundamentals}.
This thesis focuses on numerical methods that can be formulated on a hierarchy of structured grids, and, in the following, we restrict ourselves to this particular grid type.
Furthermore, while there exists a wide range of different PDEs, of which many also describe time-dependent phenomena, we only discuss discretization methods that can be applied in the spatial domain.
However, note that the techniques described in this thesis can, in principle, also be utilized for the numerical solution of time-dependent PDEs, for instance, by applying them within an implicit time-stepping scheme~\cite{ames2014numerical}.
One possibility to approximate a certain (time-independent) PDE on a structured grid is to compute the Taylor series expansion around each grid point, leading to the so-called \emph{finite difference method} (FDM).

\subsection{Finite Difference Method}
For the sake of simplicity, we consider the one-dimensional function $u(x)$.
To obtain an approximation for the derivatives of $u$, we can compute its Taylor expansion in the neighborhood of $x$ with a step size $h$, which yields
\begin{equation}
	u(x + h) = u(x) + h \dv{x} u(x) + \mathcal{O}(h^2).
\end{equation}
Assuming $h$ is sufficiently small, the first-order approximation 
\begin{equation}
	\dv{x} u(x) \approx \frac{u(x + h) -  u(x)}{h}
\end{equation}
is obtained.
Furthermore, we can derive an approximation for the second-order partial derivative $\dv[2]{x}$ by considering
\begin{equation}
	u(x + h) = u(x) + h \dv{x} u(x) + \frac{h^2}{2} \dv[2]{x} u(x) + \mathcal{O}(h^3),
	\label{eq:taylor-forward}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	u(x - h) = u(x) - h \dv{x} u(x) + \frac{h^2}{2} \dv[2]{x} u(x) + \mathcal{O}(h^3).
	\label{eq:taylor-backward}
\end{equation}
Adding Equation~\eqref{eq:taylor-backward} to Equation~\eqref{eq:taylor-forward} then yields the second-order finite difference approximation
\begin{equation}
	 \dv[2]{x} u(x) \approx \frac{u(x + h) + u(x - h) - 2u(x)}{h^2}.
\end{equation}
Using the same technique similar approximation terms can be obtained for higher-dimensional functions and higher-order derivatives~\cite{strikwerda2004finite}. \\
%TODO potentiall fix
While finite differences offer a simple and straightforward way to approximate a given PDE on a set of structured grid points, in many cases the underlying physical requirements and complex geometries necessitate the use of semi-structured or even unstructured grids together with more complicated discretization approaches such as the finite volume (FVM) and finite element method (FEM)~\cite{versteeg2007introduction,zienkiewicz2005finite}
\subsection{Model Problem}
To illustrate the approach described in the previous section, we consider the following model problem, which represents a two-dimensional version of Poisson's equation:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} u(x,y) - \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} u(x,y) = f(x, y) \quad & \forall x, y \in (0, 1) \\
		u(0, y) = u(x, 0) = u(1, y) = u(x, 1) = 0 \quad & \forall x, y \in (0, 1)
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:2D-poisson-model}
\end{equation}
Note that this equation corresponds to the two-dimensional steady-state heat equation with constant $\alpha = 1$ on the unit square $\Omega = ( 0, 1 )^2$.
We then discretize Equation~\eqref{eq:2D-poisson-model} using finite differences and a uniform step size $h$, which yields
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\frac{1}{h^2} (4 u_{i,j} - u_{i-1, j} - u_{i+1, j} - u_{i, j-1} - u_{i, j+1}) = f_{i, j} \\
		u_{0, j} = u_{i, 0} = u_{n+1, j} = u_{i, n+1} = 0,
	\end{aligned} 
	\label{eq:2D-poisson-model-discrete}
\end{equation}
$\forall i, j \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ with $u_{i,j} = u(ih, jh)$, $f_{i,j} = f(ih, jh)$ and $n = 1/h - 1$.
By defining a unique ordering of the grid points $u_{i, j}$, Equation~\eqref{eq:2D-poisson-model-discrete} can be formulated as a system of linear equation of type $A \bm{u} = \bm{f}$. 
For instance, setting $h = 0.25$, results in $n = 3$ and a total number of nine grid points.
%TODO draw grid
By incorporating the given Dirichlet BCs, which assume a constant value of zero at all boundary points, into the right-hand side $\bm{f}$ and by applying a natural ordering of the grid points we obtain the system of linear equations $A \bm{u} = \bm{f}$ with
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{1}{h^2} \begin{pmatrix}
\begin{array}{ccc|ccc|ccc}~4&-1&~0&-1&~0&~0&~0&~0&~0\\-1&~4&-1&~0&-1&~0&~0&~0&~0\\~0&-1&~4&~0&~0&-1&~0&~0&~0\\\hline -1&~0&~0&~4&-1&~0&-1&~0&~0\\~0&-1&~0&-1&~4&-1&~0&-1&~0\\~0&~0&-1&~0&-1&~4&~0&~0&-1\\\hline ~0&~0&~0&-1&~0&~0&~4&-1&~0\\~0&~0&~0&~0&-1&~0&-1&~4&-1\\~0&~0&~0&~0&~0&-1&~0&-1&~4\end{array}
	\end{pmatrix},
\label{eq:2D-poisson-assembled-matrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
	\bm u = \begin{pmatrix}
	u_{11} \\ u_{12} \\ u_{13} \\ u_{21} \\ u_{22} \\ u_{23} \\ u_{31} \\ u_{32} \\ u_{33}
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
\bm f = \begin{pmatrix}
f_{11} \\
f_{12} \\ 
f_{13} \\ 
f_{21} \\ 
f_{22} \\
f_{23} \\
f_{31} \\ 
f_{32} \\
f_{33}
\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
	f_{11} + \frac{1}{h^2} (u_{10} + u_{01}) \\f_{12} + \frac{1}{h^2} u_{02} \\ f_{13} + \frac{1}{h^2} (u_{03} + u_{14})  \\ f_{21} + \frac{1}{h^2} u_{20} \\ f_{22} \\ f_{23} + \frac{1}{h^2} u_{24} \\ f_{31} + \frac{1}{h^2} (u_{30} + u_{41}) \\ f_{32} + \frac{1}{h^2} u_{42} \\ f_{33} + \frac{1}{h^2} (u_{34} + u_{43})
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
Note that $A$ represents a sparse matrix, which means that only a minority of its entries are nonzero.
Moreover, since we already represent the solution of Equation~\eqref{eq:2D-poisson-model-discrete} on a regular grid, storing the resulting linear system in a matrix-vector format is inefficient.
If we assume that each operation required for solving a system of linear equations can be formulated as a matrix-vector or vector-vector operation, it is unnecessary to store the corresponding matrix explicitly.
Instead, we only have to store the computational pattern that corresponds to a matrix-vector multiplication performed on a vector containing the grid points in a fixed order.
On regular grids, each such pattern can be represented as a so-called \emph{stencil code}.

\subsection{Stencil Codes}
\label{subsec:stencil-codes}
In the previous section, we have already introduced the notion of a regular grid, which can be defined more formally as
\begin{equation}
	G_{h} = \left\{ \bm{x} : \bm{x} = \bm{i} \circ \bm{h}, \bm{i} \in \mathbb{N}^d \right\},
\end{equation}
where $d \in \mathbb{N}$ is the dimensionality of the problem, and $\bm{i} \circ \bm{h}$ represents the Hadamard (or element-wise) product between two vectors $\bm{i}$ and $\bm{h}$.\footnote{Even though when used as a subscript, the step size $h$ might represent a vector, we avoid the use of bold letters for better readability in all subsequent equations.}
A grid function or variable $u_h$ is then a mapping of the form
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		& u_h : G_{h}\to \mathbb{C} \\
		& \bm{x} \to u_h(\bm{x}).
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
As in the previous section, one often makes use of the simplified notation
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		 & u_i = u_{h_x}(i h_x) \\
		& u_{i,j} = u_{h_x, h_y}(i h_x, j h_y) \\
		& u_{i,j,k} = u_{h_x, h_y, h_z}(i h_x, j h_y, k h_z).
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
We then define the general stencil $S$ as a finite set of $m$ tuples of the following form:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
			& S = \{(\bm{a}_k, b_k) \}_{k=1}^m = \{(\bm{a}_1, b_1),  (\bm{a}_2, b_2), \dots, (\bm{a}_m, b_m)\}, m \in \mathbb{N}
	\\ & \forall \, i, j, k \in \{1, 2, \dots, m \}: \,
	\bm{a}_k \in \mathbb{Z}^d \wedge \bm{a}_i \neq \bm{a}_j \; \text{if} \; i \neq j, \; b_k \in \mathbb{C}
	\end{split}
\label{eq:stencil-definition}
\end{equation}
Here, the left entry $\bm{a}_k$ of each tuple $(\bm{a}_k, b_k)$ denotes the \emph{offset} from the index of the current grid point and the left entry $b_k$ the respective \emph{weight} or \emph{value}.
From a mathematical point of view, stencils are indistinguishable from regular sets, and thus their special properties are simply derived from the way they are constructed.
Furthermore, note that a specific stencil instance is independent of the step size $\bm{h}$, and the interpretation of each individual offset $\bm{a}_k$ depends on the grid function to which the stencil is applied.
For one and two-dimensional problems, it is often more convenient to use the alternative notations 
\begin{equation}
	S_{h_x} = \begin{bmatrix}
		\cdots & s_{-1} & s_{0} & s_{1} & \cdots
	\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	S_{h_x, h_y} = \begin{bmatrix}
		& \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \\
		\cdots & s_{1,-1} & s_{1,0} & s_{1,1} & \cdots \\
		\cdots & s_{0,-1} & s_{0,0} & s_{0,1} & \cdots \\
		\cdots & s_{-1,-1} & s_{-1,0} & s_{-1,1} & \cdots \\
		& \vdots & \vdots & \vdots &
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
We can also extend this notation to three dimensions by representing all components with the same offset as a separate two-dimensional stencil, such that
\begin{equation}
	S_{h_x, h_y, h_z} = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\cdots & S^{(k-1)} & S^{(k)} & S^{(k+1)} & \cdots 
	\end{bmatrix}.
\label{eq:3D-stencil-matrix-notation}
\end{equation}

Furthermore, we define the application of a stencil $S$ to a grid function $u_h(\bm x)$ with $\bm x \in G_h$:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		& S \cdot u_h(\bm{x}) = \sum_{k=1}^m b_k u_h({\bm x + \bm{a}_k} \circ \bm{h}) \quad 
		\text{with} \; \bm{x} \in G_h, m \in \mathbb{N} \\ & (\bm{a}_k, b_k) \in S \; \forall \, k \in \{ 1, 2, \dots, m \}
	\end{split}
\label{eq:stencil-application}
\end{equation}
For $d = 3$, we can define the application of a three-dimensional stencil $S_{h_x, h_y, h_z}$, based on Equation~\eqref{eq:3D-stencil-matrix-notation}, as a dot product of the form
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	& S_{h_x, h_y, h_z} \cdot u_{i,j,k} = 	
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\cdots & S^{(k-1)} & S^{(k)} & S^{(k+1)} & \cdots 
	\end{bmatrix} \cdot
	\begin{bmatrix}
	\vdots \\ u_{i,j,k-1} \\ u_{i,j,k} \\ u_{i,j,k+1} \\ \vdots 
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	& = \cdots \, + S^{(k-1)} \cdot u_{i,j,k-1} + S^{(k)} \cdot u_{i,j,k} + S^{(k+1)} \cdot u_{i,j,k+1} + \, \cdots
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

As an example, we consider the following five-point stencil defined on a two-dimensional regular grid with uniform step size $h_x = h_y = h$:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		-\Delta_{h,h} = & \bigg\{ \left( \left( 0,0 \right), \frac{4}{h^2}\right), \left(\left(1,0\right), \frac{-1}{h^2}\right), \left(\left(-1,0\right), \frac{-1}{h^2}\right), \\ & \left(\left(0,1\right), \frac{-1}{h^2}\right), \left(\left(0,-1\right), \frac{-1}{h^2}\right) \bigg\}
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:five-point-stencil}
\end{equation}
Applying $-\Delta_{h,h}$ to a given point $u_{i,j}$ yields 
\begin{equation}
	-\Delta_{h,h} \cdot u_{i,j} = \frac{1}{h^2} \left(4 u_{i,j}  - u_{i-1,j} - u_{i+1,j} - u_{i,j-1} - u_{i,j-1}\right),
\end{equation}
which corresponds precisely to the left part of Equation~\eqref{eq:2D-poisson-model-discrete}.
From this example, we can conclude that applying a given stencil to a grid function $u_h(\bm{x})$ defined on a regular grid can always be considered as a sparse matrix-vector product, where the matrix is obtained by sorting the grid points according to a well-defined order.
We have already illustrated this fact using the example of Equation~\eqref{eq:2D-poisson-assembled-matrix}.
Therefore, in case it is possible to define each computational step for solving a given discretized PDE on a regular grid by means of a stencil application, we only need to obtain the respective stencil entries instead of assembling or even storing a complete matrix.
Furthermore, many operators defined for matrices can similarly be formulated as a stencil operation.
As a first elementary operation, we define the multiplication of a stencil with a scalar, which is simply achieved by multiplying the weight of each entry with the respective value:
% Scalar multiplication
\begin{equation}
	\alpha S = \{(\bm{a}_k, \alpha b_k) \}_{k=1}^m, m \in \mathbb{N}
\end{equation}

Next, we can formulate certain binary operations such as the addition, subtraction, and multiplication of two stencils $A$ and $B$.
Equation~\eqref{eq:stencil-addsub} shows a recursive definition of stencil addition and subtraction.
% Stencil addition and subtraction
\begin{equation}
	A \pm B = 
	\begin{cases}
		\{(\bm{a}, b\pm c ) \} \cup (\tilde{A} \pm \tilde{B}) & \text{if} \; A = 	\{(\bm{a}, b ) \} \cup \tilde{A} \\
		& \text{and} \; B = \{(\bm{a}, c ) \} \cup \tilde{B} \\
		
		\{(\bm{a}, b ) \} \cup (\tilde{A} \pm B) & \text{if} \; A = 	\{(\bm{a}, b ) \} \cup \tilde{A} \\
		& \text{and} \; \nexists  c \in \mathbb{C} : \{(\bm{a}, c ) \} \in B 
		\\
% TODO case probably unnecessary
%		\{(\bm{a}, c ) \} \cup (A \pm \tilde{B}) & \text{if} \; B = 	\{(\bm{a}, c ) \} \cup \tilde{B} \wedge
%		\{(\bm{a}, b ) \} \notin A \; \forall b \in \mathbb{C}
%		\\
		A & \text{if} \; B = \emptyset
		\\
		B & \text{else} 
		\\
	\end{cases}
\label{eq:stencil-addsub}
\end{equation}
Here, we simply add the weights of each entry with the same offset contained in both $A$ and $B$.
In case an offset is not contained in both stencils, the respective tuple is included unmodified.  
Based on Equation~\eqref{eq:stencil-addsub}, we can then provide a definition for the multiplication of two stencils $A$, and $B$, which can be seen as a recursive version of the iterative computation scheme described in~\cite{rittich2018extending}:
% Stencil multiplication
\begin{equation}
	A \cdot B = 
	\begin{cases}
		\{(\bm{a} + \bm{\hat{a}}, b \cdot \hat{b} ) \} \; + & \text{if} \; A = \{(\bm{a}, b ) \} \cup \tilde{A} \\
		\{(\bm{a}, b ) \} \cdot \tilde{B} + \tilde{A} \cdot B & 
		\text{and} \; B = \{(\bm{\hat{a}}, \hat{b} ) \} \cup \tilde{B} \\ & \\
		\emptyset & \text{else} %\text{if} \; A = \emptyset \vee B = \emptyset
	\end{cases}
\label{eq:stencil-mult}
\end{equation}
To compute the stencil product $A \cdot B$, for each pair of entries $\{(\bm{a}, b ) \} \in A$ and $\{(\bm{\hat{a}}, \hat{b} ) \} \in B$ the tuple $\{(\bm{a} + \bm{\hat{a}}, b \cdot \hat{b} ) \}$ needs to be formed.
We then define this computation recursively by first picking two entries $\{(\bm{a}, b ) \} \in A$ and $\{(\bm{\hat{a}}, \hat{b} ) \} \in B$ and combining them as described above.
Next, we multiply the entry $\{(\bm{a}, b ) \}$ chosen from $A$ with the remainder stencil $\tilde{B} = B \setminus \{(\bm{\hat{a}}, \hat{b} ) \}$, which means that we now obtain the combination of this entry with all remaining ones from $B$.
Finally, the process is continued recursively by computing the product of the remainder $\tilde{A} = A \setminus \{(\bm{a}, b ) \}$ with the original stencil $B$.
Since it is possible that the combination of different pairs of stencil offsets leads to the same result, we, additionally, need to accumulate the corresponding weights and combine them in a single tuple.
To sum up all tuples with matching offsets obtained within subcomputations, we employ stencil addition, as defined in Equation~\eqref{eq:stencil-addsub}.
\subsection{Systems of Partial Differential Equations}
\label{subsec:systems-of-pdes}
While so far, we have only considered a single partial differential equation, many phenomena can only be modeled in the form of a system of PDEs.
One of the simplest examples of such a system is the so-called biharmonic equation
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\nabla^2 u & = v  \\
		\nabla^2 v & = f.
	\end{split}
\label{eq:biharmonic-system}
\end{equation}
Note that this system is mathematically equivalent to the scalar equation 
\begin{equation}
	\nabla^4 u = f.
\end{equation}
By utilizing matrix-vector notation, we can reformulate Equation~\eqref{eq:biharmonic-system} as
\begin{equation}
	\underbrace{
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\nabla^2 & -1 \\
		0 & \nabla^2
	\end{pmatrix}}_{A}
\underbrace{ 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		u \\ v
	\end{pmatrix}
}_{\bm{u}}
=
\underbrace{
\begin{pmatrix}
	0 \\ f
\end{pmatrix}
}_{\bm{f}}.
\label{eq:biharmonic-system-matrix-formulation}
\end{equation}
Even though Equation~\eqref{eq:biharmonic-system-matrix-formulation} now includes partial derivatives of multiple variables, we can employ the same techniques to discretize each individual operator and obtain the corresponding system of linear equations. 
Consider the two-dimensional biharmonic system
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		& \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} u(x,y) + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} u(x,y) - v(x, y) = 0 \\
		& \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} v(x,y) + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} v(x,y) = f(x, y) \quad \forall x, y \in (0, 1)^2.
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:2D-biharmonic-system}
\end{equation}
Discretizing Equation~\eqref{eq:2D-biharmonic-system} using finite differences with a uniform step size $h_x = h_y = h$ and rewriting the resulting equations in stencil form yields
\begin{equation}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\Delta_{h, h} & -1 \\
			0 & \Delta_{h, h}
	\end{pmatrix}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			u_{i,j} \\ v_{i,j}
		\end{pmatrix}
	=
		\begin{pmatrix}
			0 \\ f_{i,j}
		\end{pmatrix} \quad
\forall i,j \in \{1, 2, \dots, n\},
	\label{eq:2D-biharmonic-system-stencil}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta_{h,h}$ is the two-dimensional five-point stencil defined in Equation~\eqref{eq:five-point-stencil}.
Equation~\eqref{eq:2D-biharmonic-system-stencil} represents a system of two linear equations which needs to be solved at every pair of grid points $u_{i,j}$ and $v_{i,j}$.
If we consider Equation~\eqref{eq:2D-biharmonic-system-stencil} at all grid points, a system of linear equations which corresponds to the discrete solution of Equation~\eqref{eq:2D-biharmonic-system} is obtained.

Before we conclude this section, it is important to mention that we have not yet discussed how each variable, in the given case $u_{i,j}$ and $v_{i,j}$, is placed on the grid.
While it is tempting to always place each variable at the same position within a grid, in certain applications, such as the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, this can lead to unfavorable numerical properties.
As a consequence, often more complex grid placing strategies, such as so-called staggered discretizations, need to be used in practice~\cite{trottenberg2000multigrid}, which we, for the sake of brevity, do not further discuss here.
Also note that in order to solve Equation~\eqref{eq:2D-biharmonic-system}, or any other system of PDEs, we need to define suitable conditions at the boundaries of each domain on which a given variable, contained in one of the equations, is defined.
After briefly discussing numerical discretization methods that allow us to convert a given system of PDEs into a system of linear equations, we can next direct our attention to the efficient solution of these systems.
%These boundary conditions can be of the same type as described above.
%Again, for a more detailed treatment of boundary conditions for systems of PDEs, the reader is referred to %TODO insert suitable reference.
