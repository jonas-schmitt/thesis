\section{Multigrid Methods}
Multigrid methods have been designed to accelerate the convergence of iterative methods by eliminating certain error components on a so-called coarser representation of the original problem.
While the basic iterative methods discussed in the last section are applicable to many PDE-based problems, in practice, their speed of convergence is often insufficient, which means that a large number of iterations is required until an acceptable approximation accuracy can be attained. 
The main reason for this behavior is that these methods are only efficient in the reduction of certain error components, while others remain mostly unaffected~\cite{briggs2000multigrid}.
