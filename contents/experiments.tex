As a first step in the evaluation of our grammar-guided evolutionary search method, we consider two PDE-based model problems, Poisson's equation and a linear elastic boundary value problem, which can already be solved efficiently through iterative application of common multigrid cycles .
Here, our goal is, first of all, to demonstrate that our approach is able to reliably find functioning multigrid solvers in a number of randomized independent experiments.
Furthermore, since the known multigrid cycles already provide a strong baseline for these problems, we can investigate whether the methods evolved by our approach are able to achieve a similarly high degree of efficiency.
In addition, by considering both two and three-dimensional problems as well as a system of PDEs, we can demonstrate that our implementation is able to handle PDEs of different type.
\section{Evolving Monolithic Multigrid Solvers}
As it has been mentioned above, the goal of this section is to evaluate the effectiveness of our evolutionary search method in evolving multigrid methods that can be used as a standalone method for the numerical solution of a given PDE.
Therefore, the problem instances considered in this section are chosen in a way that facilitates their efficient solution by multigrid.
This is reflected in the fact that common multigrid cycles, as described in Section~\ref{sec:multigrid-cycles}, are able to quickly converge to the correct solution of each of the resulting systems of linear equations.
We begin this section by introducing the considered problem instances and their mathematical formulation. 
\subsection{Poisson's Equation}
\label{sec:poisson-equation}
Poisson's equation is an elliptic PDE that occurs in the study of many physical phenomena~\cite{folland2020introduction} and is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		-\nabla^{2} u & = f \quad \text{in} \; \Omega \\
		u & = g \quad \text{on} \; \partial \Omega.
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:poisson}
\end{equation}
In our experimental evaluation, we consider two different instances of Poisson's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, which are summarized in Table~\ref{table:poisson-problems}.
\begin{table}
	\begin{tabular}{r l l}
		\toprule
		Problem & 2D Poisson & 3D Poisson \\
		\midrule
		$\Omega = $ & $ (0, 1)^2$ & $(0, 1)^3$ \\
		\midrule
		$f(\mathbf{x}) = $ & $\pi^2 \cos(\pi x) - 4 \pi^2 \sin(2 \pi y)$ & $x^2 - 0.5 y^2 - 0.5 z^2$ \\
		\midrule
		$g(\mathbf{x}) = $ & $\cos(\pi x) - \sin(\pi y)$ & $0$ \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Poisson problem instances.}
	\label{table:poisson-problems}
\end{table}
Note that in Section~\ref{sec:execution-time-analysis} we have utilized the same two-dimensional instance of Poisson's equation to estimate the relative cost of each operation within our evolutionary search method.
We discretize the Laplace operator $\nabla^{2}$ with finite differences on a uniform cartesian grid with step size $h = 1/2^{l_{max}}$.
As a consequence, we obtain the five point stencil
\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2_h = 
	\frac{1}{h^2} \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 1 & 0\\
		1 & -4 & 1 \\
		0 & 1 & 0  
	\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation*}
in two dimensions and the seven point stencil
\begin{equation*}
\nabla^2_h = 
\frac{1}{h^2} \begin{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0
	\end{bmatrix}
	&		
	\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 1 & 0 \\
	1 & -6 & 1 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 
	\end{bmatrix} &
	\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*} in three dimensions.
We choose a maximum level of $l_{max} = 11$ in 2D and $l_{max} = 7$ in 3D, which yields systems of linear equations consisting of $4\,190\,209$ and $2\,048\,383$ unknowns, respectively.

\subsection{Linear Elasticity}
Linear elasticity is a fundamental branch of solid mechanics with numerous applications in engineering and material science~\cite{holzapfel2001nonlinear}.
It simplifies the more general theory of nonlinear continuum mechanics by assuming a linear relationship between stress and strain during elastic deformation.
We consider a two-dimensional linear elastic boundary value problem given by the system of PDEs
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		(\alpha + \beta) \cdot (\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} u + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} v) + \alpha \nabla^2 u & = 0 \quad \text{in} \; \Omega \\
		(\alpha + \beta) \cdot (\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} u + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} v) + \alpha \nabla^2 v & = 0 \quad \text{in} \; \Omega \\
		u = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad v & = g \quad \text{on} \; \partial \Omega 
		\label{eq:linear-elasticity}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega = (0,1)^2$, $\alpha = 195$, $\beta = 130$ and
\begin{equation*}
	g(x,y) = 0.4 \, (1 - x) \, x y \, \sin(\pi x).
\end{equation*}
From a physical point of view, this system can be interpreted as a two-dimensional rectangular body that undergoes an elastic deformation into y-direction, as it can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:visualization-linear-elasticity}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/visualization-linear-elasticity1}
	\caption{Visualization of the considered linear elastic boundary value problem. A two-dimensional rectangular body undergoes an elastic deformation into y-direction.}
	\label{fig:visualization-linear-elasticity}
\end{figure}
We discretize equation \eqref{eq:linear-elasticity} with finite differences on a cartesian grid using a step size $h = 1/2^{l_{max}}$ with $l_{max} = 10$, which yields a system of linear equations $\boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{u} = \boldsymbol{f}$ with 
\begin{equation*}
	\boldsymbol{A} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		(\alpha + \beta) \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \alpha \nabla^2 & (\alpha + \beta) \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} \\
		(\alpha + \beta) \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} & (\alpha + \beta) \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} +  \alpha \nabla^2
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	\boldsymbol{u} = \begin{pmatrix}
		u \\ v
	\end{pmatrix}, \quad
	\boldsymbol{f} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		f_{u} \\ f_{v}
	\end{pmatrix} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0 \\ 0
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
whereby the differential operators $\nabla^2$, $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$, $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}$ and $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y}$ are approximated by their discrete counterparts
\begin{equation*}
	\left(\nabla^2 u\right)_{i,j} = 
	\frac{1}{h^2} \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 1 & 0\\
		1 & -4 & 1 \\
		0 & 1 & 0  
	\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} u\right)_{i,j} =
		\frac{1}{h^2} \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 0 & 0\\
		1 & -2 & 1 \\
		0 & 0 & 0  
	\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} u\right)_{i,j} =
	\frac{1}{h^2} \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 1 & 0\\
		0 & -2 & 0 \\
		0 & 1 & 0  
	\end{bmatrix},
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} u\right)_{i,j} = 
	\frac{1}{4 h^2} \begin{bmatrix}
		-1 & 0 & 1\\
		0 & 0 & 0 \\
		1 & 0 & -1  
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
Similar to the above case, we employ a uniform cartesian grid of size $h = 1/l_{max}$ with $l_{max} = 10$, such that the resulting system of linear equations contains $2\,093\,058$ unknowns.
\subsection{Multigrid Configuration}
To design a multigrid method, we consider each of the given problems a grid hierarchy consisting of five discretization levels $l \in \left[l_{max} - 4, l_{max}\right]$, where the grid spacing on each level is given by the formula $h = 1/2^l$.
We then obtain the respective operator on each level by applying the same discretization method as described above.
Furthermore, we consider the following components within the respective step of each method:
\begin{description}
	\item[\textbf{Smoothers}:] Decoupled / Collective Jacobi and red-black Gauss-Seidel, block Jacobi with rectangular blocks up to a maximum number of 6 terms.
	\item[\textbf{Restriction}:] Full-weighting restriction.
	\item[\textbf{Prolongation}:] Bilinear interpolation.
	\item[\textbf{Relaxation factors}:] $\omega \in \left( 0.1 + 0.05i \right)_{i = 0}^{36} = \left(0.1, 0.15, 0.2, \dots 1.9 \right)$
	\item[\textbf{Coarse-grid solver}:] Conjugate gradient method for $l = l_{max} - 4$.
\end{description}
Here, we generate block Jacobi smoothers by defining a splitting $A = L + D + U$ where $D$ is a block diagonal matrix of the form
\begin{equation*}
	D = 
		\begin{pmatrix}A_{11}&0&\cdots &0\\
			0&A_{22}&\cdots &0\\
			\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\0&0&\cdots &A_{mm}\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation*}
where each matrix $A_{ij}$ corresponds to a set of adjacent grid points contained in the respective rectangular block, as it has been discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:block-smoothing}.
A more detailed treatment of block relaxation methods, can be found in~\cite{trottenberg2000multigrid}.
Finall, the relaxation factor $\omega$ for each smoothing and coarse-grid correction step is chosen from the above sequence.
As a baseline for assessing the efficiency and generalizability of the evolved multigrid solvers, we consider a number of common multigrid cycles with red-black Gauss-Seidel smoothing and optimized relaxation factors.
We, therefore, formulate these methods on the same five-grid hierarchy, whereby we also utilize the same restriction, prolongation operators and coarse-grid solver, as described above.
